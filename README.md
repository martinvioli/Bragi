<br/><br/>  
## 🔎 What is Bragi, you may ask:

<p>
Bragi is a <mark>&nbsp;social network&nbsp;</mark> focused on bringing an artist closer to their fans, being able to
<mark>&nbsp;share posts,&nbsp;</mark> there is also the functionality of being able to search for the most recognized artists, as well as their albums and songs, along with the possibility of being able to see the top 10 songs, albums and artists of the moment.
Users can follow both their favorite artists and other users
</p>

## ❔ What does it mean Bragi?

<p>
Since our page was focused on music, we decided to look for something that represents this.<br/> With this thought we come to Bragi, god of Norse mythology, who represented "music", which at that time was poetry and bards.<br/>
Bragi, also, is associated with bragr, the Norse word for poetry. Just as the god Bragi, he was able to connect other deities with music and poetry through his compositions, the main purpose of the Bragi App is to connect the singer with his fans through his music-oriented posts. <br /><br />
At Bragi we want our users to feel comfortable and for that we want to give you the best possible experience, so we ask you to write
to us if you have any doubts, questions or criticisms. We hope you
enjoy our website
